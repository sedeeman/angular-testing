# TestingAngularApp

The web application may experience interruptions or stop functioning altogether due to errors caused by missing dependencies, undefined variables, or poorly formatted data. This demo project focuses on the process of testing and debugging in Angular applications to identify and resolve these types of errors.

Common error messages are broken down, and a range of testing and debugging options are explored. Code linting is covered in this project, along with sharing tips and tricks to avoid pitfalls during the development process. Additionally, custom error handlers are discussed to enhance error management as your application expands.

By the end of this project, you will have gained the knowledge and skills to effectively track down and eliminate errors in your Angular applications, ensuring their smooth and reliable performance
